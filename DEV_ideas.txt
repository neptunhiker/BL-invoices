DEV IDEAS

I ABOUT
• What is the software application or feature?
An application to automate various functionalities for BL such as time tracking of coaching, invoice creation, participant certificates, coaching documentation.

• Who’s it intended for?
It is intended to be used by BL employees.

• What problem does the software solve?
It is intended to automate routine tasks that have to be repeated over and over again.

• How is it going to work?
The software is supposed to retrieve data from a database and display them in a GUI that allows the user to create various outputs such as pdfs or excel documents.

• What are the main concepts that are involved and how are they related?
?

II USER INTERFACE
• What are the main user stories (happy flows + alternative flows)?
a) BL employee creates, reads, updates, or deletes a database entry for a coaching participant.
b) BL employee creates output for various use cases such as 
ba) invoices, 
bb) time tracking sheets that need to be signed by the participant and the coaches
bc) participation certificates
bd) documentation document of coachings
be) personalized memorandum of understanding for the participant and/or the coach at the beginning of the training

• If you’re adding a new feature to an existing software application, what impact does the feature
have on the overall structure of the interface? (e.g. are there big changes in the organization of
menus, navigation, and so on?)
The application should have two options at the beginning
a) Database operations, i.e. CRUD
b) Output operations that should easily be extendible by additional options

III TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
• What technical details need developers to know to develop the software or new feature?
a) Python
b) SQL

• Are there new tables to add to the database? What fields?
Yes, the tables to the database should be
a) BL employee
b) Participant
c) Coach
c) AVGS Gutschein
e) Maßnahmen
d) Coachings
f) Coaching hours
g) Job Center
h) Output

• How will the software technically work? Are there particular algorithms or libraries that are
important?
a) Database likely to be developed with SQLLite and SQLLiteStudio
b) GUI with tkinter
c) PDF with reportlab

• What will be the overall design? Which classes are needed? What design patterns are used to
model the concepts and relationships?
Still to be clarified, maybe use UML diagram and consider SOLID

• What third-party software is needed to build the software or feature?
a) python libraries
b) SQLLite

IV TESTING and SECURITY
• Are there specific coverage goals for the unit tests?
• What kinds of tests are needed (unit, regression, end-to-end, etc)?
• (new feature only) Are there any potential side-effects on other areas of the application when
adding this feature?
• What security checks need to be in place to allow the software to ship?
• (new feature only) How does the feature impact the security of the software? Is there a need for
a security audit before the feature is shipped?

V DEPLOYMENT
• Are there any architectural or DevOps changes needed (e.g. adding an extra microservice,
changes in deployment pipelines, adding secrets to services)?
• Are there any migration scripts that need to be written?

VI PLANNING
• How much time will developing the software or feature cost?
• What are the steps and how much time does step take?
• What are the developmental milestones and in what order?
• What are the main risk factors and are there any alternative routes to take if you find out
something isn’t feasible?
• What parts are absolutely required, and what parts can optionally be done at a later stage? (i.e.
the Definition of Done)

VII BROADER CONTEXT
• What are limitations of the current design?
• What are possible extensions to think about for the future?
• Any other considerations?
